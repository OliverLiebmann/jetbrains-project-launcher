# Configuration file for JetBrains Project Launcher

# Each IDE has its own section.
# Define the original_desktop_entry for each IDE project folder.
# To disable an entry, simply comment out the 'original_desktop_entry' line for that section.

# Example:
# Uncomment the following line to enable IntelliJ IDEA projects
# [IdeaProjects]
# original_desktop_entry=/usr/share/applications/jetbrains-idea.desktop

# Uncomment the following line to enable PyCharm projects
# [PyCharmProjects]
# original_desktop_entry=/usr/share/applications/jetbrains-pycharm.desktop

# Uncomment and add more entries for other JetBrains IDEs as needed:
# [WebStormProjects]
# original_desktop_entry=/usr/share/applications/jetbrains-webstorm.desktop

# [CLionProjects]
# original_desktop_entry=/usr/share/applications/jetbrains-clion.desktop

# [RiderProjects]
# original_desktop_entry=/usr/share/applications/jetbrains-rider.desktop

# Notes:
# - Use absolute paths for the desktop entry files.
# - Ensure the directory names match your actual project directory names.
# - Customize this file as per your requirements.
